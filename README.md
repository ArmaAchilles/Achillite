# Achillite
**Achillite** is a light-weighted editor expansion for [Arma 3 Zeus](https://store.steampowered.com/app/275700/Arma_3_Zeus/) servers that run `zeusCompositionScriptLevel=2`.
It is partially based on the now _deprecated_ [Achilles](https://github.com/ArmaAchilles/Achilles) mod.
If you are looking for a full-fledged Zeus editor expansion, check out [Zeus Enhanced](https://github.com/zen-mod/ZEN) instead.
