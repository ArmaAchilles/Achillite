**Achillite** is a light-weighted client-side editor expansion for [Arma 3 Zeus](https://store.steampowered.com/app/275700/Arma_3_Zeus/) servers that run `zeusCompositionScriptLevel=2`.
It is partially based on the now _deprecated_ [Achilles](https://github.com/ArmaAchilles/Achilles) mod.
If you are looking for a full-fledged Zeus editor expansion, check out [Zeus Enhanced](https://github.com/zen-mod/ZEN) instead.

## Installation
1. Subscribe to the composition on the Steam Workshop or get the composition manually from the [GitHub release](https://github.com/ArmaAchilles/Achillite/releases).
2. Play as Zeus.
3. Place the "Achillite Initializer" composition found in the category "Other".
4. Have fun!
